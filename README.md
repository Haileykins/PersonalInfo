# PersonalInfo
A simple yet complex Spigot (or Bungeecord, thanks to the new utilizaition of SQlite and MySQL) plugin for Minecraft Servers that allows players to set more personal information about themselves in an environment that the server management can control. There is a lot that can be done with this plugin, everything down to the last message is configurable.

# Contributing
Want to contribute? While I appriciate anyone who attempts to make a contribution I will only accept those that follow proper Java convetions and do something outstanding to the plugin or fix issues I didn't catch or have't/don't have time to fix myself.

# Where can I Download The JAR?
